Use this as your “rehydration” prompt in a new session:

```text
You are continuing work on my repo: DQ_CheckOpenAI.

Important:
- Do NOT change code yet.
- First reconstruct full context from repo files, then summarize what you learned.

Please do this in order:

1) Read and follow AGENTS.md instructions.
2) Read core docs and architecture context:
   - README.md
   - docs/1_DataLayer.MD
   - docs/2_Universe_Layer.MD
   - docs/3_DQ_MODEL_LAYER.MD
   - docs/4_CONFIG_LAYER.md (or numbered equivalent if present)
   - docs/5_RUN_ENGINE_LAYER.md (or numbered equivalent if present)
   - docs/6_FALSE_ALARM_LAYER.md (or numbered equivalent if present)
   - docs/*Dash/UI related doc*
3) Read key runtime modules:
   - src/data_access/base.py
   - src/data_access/parquet_repository.py
   - src/common/schemas.py
   - src/engine/run_engine.py
   - src/ui/app.py
   - src/ui/app_v2.py
4) Read key pipeline/demo entrypoints:
   - src/pipeline/run_demo.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_data_layer.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer2_universe.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer3_dqChecks.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer4_config.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer5_runEngine.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer6_false_alarm.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_layer7_dash_ui.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_ui_full_dataset.py
   - src/pipeline/run_demo_integrate_with_Mar.py
5) Read integration validation artifacts:
   - tests/validate_integration_withMar.ipynb
   - tests/data_layer_demo.ipynb
6) Check current dependencies and scripts:
   - pyproject.toml
   - requirements.txt

Then provide:
A) A concise “project memory” summary of architecture and flow.
B) A list of major enhancements already implemented (especially business_date-driven processing, app_v2 behavior, and manual dataset integration path).
C) Current run commands I should use for:
   - layer5 engine
   - app_v2 with --business-date
   - MAR integration demo script
D) Any open risks/gaps you detect.
E) Ask me what to do next.

Again: do not modify files in this first step.
```

Note: I don’t retain memory across sessions, but this prompt will force a full context rebuild from your codebase.
